# Game-2048-python
This is a graphical game called 2048 with Python.
2048 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game.
The game's objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048.
However, one can continue to play the game after reaching the goal, creating tiles with larger numbers.
But if you cannot combine them, you'll be game over.
You can use the up, down, right and left keys on your laptop keyboard to move slide numbered tiles  and combine them.
